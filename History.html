        <h2>Information</h2>
        <p>Churchill House was built by
            the Winston Churchill
            Memorial Trust of Australia.
            The Trust began consideration
            of erecting a building of its
            own in 1967 and formed a
            building committee in 1968. In
            1969 it acquired a lease for
            land on Northbourne Avenue,
            the current site, and engaged
            the architect
            Robin Boyd to design the
            building.</p>
    <div class="column1"></div>
        <p>The building was to provide
        offices for the Trust and in
        addition was to provide rental
        office accommodation for
        commercial tenants as a means
        of generating income for the
        Trust. Features of the original
        design included:
        - a glass exhibition pavilion, on the site of the
        current north wing, which housed a display on
        the work of the Trust;
        
        - the flat roof area of the east and south wings
        which was intended to be a roof terrace; and
        
        - accommodation in the building included a
        board room, dining room, reception area, bar
        and kitchen.
        The cost of the works was about $1 million. The
        building was officially opened on 14 April 1972.
        
        
        Boyd died in 1971 before completion, and W K
        Williams was engaged by the Trust as its site
        representative to replace Boyd.
        
        
        Robin Boyd CBE HFRAIA (1919-1971) is a noted
        Australian architect. Boyd was a member of a
        prominent artistic family, and combined a
        career as an architect, author and critic
        (Clerehan 1993). He was strongly influenced by
        the Modern Movement, and deeply interested in
        the development of Australian architecture. Boyd
        is often remembered best for his domestic
        architecture, as well as his books, but he also
        produced designs for larger scale works, such as
        in the case of Churchill House. Boyd was
        awarded the Gold Medal by the RAIA in 1969</p>
